## Core Frameworks

### The 5-Phase Adoption Engine

**Definition**: A systematic framework for executing AI adoption from assessment to production scaling.

**Phases**:
1. **Readiness Assessment** - Evaluate organizational maturity and readiness
2. **Strategic Prioritization** - Determine which initiatives to pursue first
3. **Building the Roadmap** - Create a structured implementation plan
4. **Measuring True Value** - Track ROI, ROE, and ROF
5. **Scaling to Production** - Move from pilots to industrialized AI

**Location**: `docs/adoption-engine/overview.md`  
**Related**: Individual phase documents in `docs/adoption-engine/`

### The Human-Centric Operating Model

**Definition**: A framework addressing the human element of AI adoption, focusing on change management, talent development, and organizational culture.

**Components**:
- Employee Value Proposition (EVP) for AI era
- Change Management Playbook (based on McKinsey's "Rewired")
- 6-Step Upskilling Framework
- Shadow AI Management (4-Step Plan)

**Location**: `docs/human-centric-adoption/overview.md`  
**Key Principle**: 81% of AI adoption failures are human-centric

### EU Governance & Compliance Framework

**Definition**: Comprehensive framework for navigating EU regulatory requirements for AI systems.

**Components**:
- EU AI Act Compliance Path
- Gartner's AI TRiSM Framework
- NIS2 Directive Integration
- Digital Sovereignty Strategy
- Agentic AI Governance

**Location**: `docs/governance-compliance/overview.md`  
**Focus**: EU-specific regulatory landscape

## Key Concepts

### AI Maturity Assessment

**Definition**: Tool for evaluating organizational readiness across multiple dimensions.

**Dimensions**: Typically includes leadership, culture, technology, data, and processes.

**Location**: `docs/adoption-engine/readiness-assessment.md`  
**Use Case**: Phase 1 of Adoption Engine

### Strategic Prioritization Frameworks

**Definition**: Six different models for ranking and prioritizing AI initiatives.

**Frameworks Included**:
1. Value vs. Effort Matrix
2. Risk-Adjusted ROI
3. Strategic Alignment Score
4. Technical Feasibility Assessment
5. Regulatory Compliance Priority
6. Change Management Complexity

**Location**: `docs/adoption-engine/prioritization.md`  
**Use Case**: Phase 2 of Adoption Engine

### 7-Workstream AI Roadmap

**Definition**: Gartner framework for structuring AI implementation across seven workstreams.

**Workstreams**: (See `docs/adoption-engine/roadmap.md` for details)

**Location**: `docs/adoption-engine/roadmap.md`  
**Use Case**: Phase 3 of Adoption Engine

### Multi-Dimensional Value Measurement

**Definition**: Framework measuring value across three dimensions: ROI, ROE (Return on Experience), and ROF (Return on Future).

**Components**:
- **ROI**: Traditional return on investment
- **ROE**: Return on Experience (user satisfaction, adoption)
- **ROF**: Return on Future (strategic positioning, capabilities)

**Location**: `docs/adoption-engine/measuring-value.md`  
**Use Case**: Phase 4 of Adoption Engine

### Pilot-to-Production Scaling

**Definition**: Framework for moving AI initiatives from pilot phase to production at scale.

**Key Concepts**:
- ModelOps
- Production deployment patterns
- Monitoring and governance
- Scaling strategies

**Location**: `docs/adoption-engine/scaling-production.md`  
**Use Case**: Phase 5 of Adoption Engine

### AI TRiSM Framework

**Definition**: Gartner's framework for Trust, Risk, and Security Management of AI systems.

**Components**: Trust, Risk, Security Management

**Location**: `docs/governance-compliance/ai-trism.md`  
**Use Case**: Governance and compliance

### Shadow AI Management

**Definition**: 4-step framework for managing unauthorized AI tool usage in organizations.

**Steps**: (See `docs/human-centric-adoption/shadow-ai.md`)

**Location**: `docs/human-centric-adoption/shadow-ai.md`  
**Use Case**: HR and IT management

### 6-Step Upskilling Framework

**Definition**: Framework for developing AI capabilities in the workforce.

**Steps**: (See `docs/human-centric-adoption/upskilling.md`)

**Location**: `docs/human-centric-adoption/upskilling.md`  
**Use Case**: HR and talent development

## Key Statistics & Data Points

### Adoption Statistics (2024-2025)

- **95%** - Organizations reporting zero measurable ROI from AI investments
- **42%** - Organizations abandoning AI projects before production (up from 17%)
- **81%** - Adoption failures that are human-centric (leadership + training)
- **78%** - Organizations using AI in at least one function
- **1%** - Organizations considering their AI rollouts mature

**Source**: Research cited throughout documentation  
**Location**: Referenced in `docs/getting-started/overview.md` and throughout

## Terminology Glossary

### AI Adoption
The process of integrating AI technologies into organizational processes and workflows.

### Change Management
Systematic approach to dealing with organizational change, particularly the human side of AI adoption.

### Digital Sovereignty
Strategic approach to maintaining control over digital infrastructure and data, particularly relevant in EU context.

### Employee Value Proposition (EVP)
The value that employees receive from their employment relationship, redefined for the AI era.

### ModelOps
Operational practices for managing AI models in production environments.

### Pilot-to-Production Chasm
The gap between successful AI pilots and scaled production deployments.

### Shadow AI
Unauthorized use of AI tools by employees without organizational oversight.

### Sovereign Cloud
Cloud infrastructure that maintains data sovereignty and regulatory compliance.

## Framework Relationships

### Adoption Engine → Human-Centric Model
The Adoption Engine provides the execution framework, while the Human-Centric Model addresses the human barriers to success.

### Governance Framework → Adoption Engine
Governance frameworks ensure compliance throughout the adoption journey.

### Checklists → All Frameworks
Role-based checklists provide actionable steps derived from the frameworks.
