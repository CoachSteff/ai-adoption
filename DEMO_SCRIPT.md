## SESSION SCRIPT

### Opening: The Problem (3 minutes)

**[Start with impact statistics - hook them immediately]**

> "Thank you all for being here. I want to start with three numbers that should concern every business leader in this room:
>
> - **95%** of AI initiatives deliver zero return on investment
> - **42%** of AI projects are abandoned within 12 months
> - **81%** of failures are caused by human factors - not technology
>
> The AI adoption crisis isn't a technology problem. It's a human behavior problem."

**[Pause for impact - let it sink in]**

> "Over the past year, I've researched why AI adoption fails and synthesized insights from McKinsey, Gartner, Deloitte, and 2024-2025 research into a comprehensive open-source playbook. Today, I want to show you what I've built and get your feedback on whether this addresses your real challenges."

**Key Message:** This is different because it's human-centric, not technology-centric.

---

### Live Demo: The Playbook (12 minutes)

#### Part 1: Overview & Navigation (3 minutes)

**[Open the documentation site - start at homepage]**

> "This is a comprehensive, open-source AI adoption guide. Let me show you how it's organized."

**[Navigate through main sections - point out structure]**

1. **Getting Started** - "Understand the landscape and why this matters"
2. **Governance & Compliance** - "EU AI Act, NIS2, GDPR - the regulatory reality"
3. **Human-Centric Adoption** - "The 81% failure factor - change management"
4. **Adoption Engine** - "5-phase framework from readiness to scaling"
5. **Checklists & Templates** - "Actionable tools you can use Monday morning"

**Key Message:** "Notice this isn't organized by technology - it's organized by business needs."

---

#### Part 2: Business Owner Checklist - Deep Dive (7 minutes)

**[Navigate to: Checklists & Templates > Business Owner Checklist]**

> "Let me show you the most relevant piece for this audience - the Business Owner Checklist. This is immediately actionable."

**Section 1: Value & Prioritization (2 min)**

**[Scroll through, highlight key items]**

- "Map your current processes and identify inefficiencies"
- "Prioritize use cases using impact/effort matrix"
- "Start with low-hanging fruit to build momentum"

**[Stop on a specific checkbox]**

> "For example: 'Identified 3-5 use cases that align with business goals.' This is where most organizations start wrong - they let technology vendors define the use cases instead of mapping to their actual business needs."

**Section 2: Measurement & ROI (2 min)**

**[Scroll to ROI section]**

- "Define success metrics before implementation"
- "Track both efficiency gains AND innovation benefits"
- "Set up feedback loops to iterate quickly"

> "Notice we don't just say 'measure ROI' - we give you a framework. ROI is efficiency. ROE is effectiveness. ROF is innovation capacity. You need all three."

**Section 3: Adoption & Governance (3 min)**

**[Highlight governance items]**

- "Establish AI usage policy before rollout"
- "Address shadow AI proactively"
- "Create communication plan for transparency"

> "This is where the human factor comes in. Shadow AI - employees using ChatGPT under the radar - is happening in your organization right now. This checklist gives you a 4-step framework to manage it constructively instead of punitively."

**[Pause for questions or reactions]**

**Key Message:** "Every checkbox is backed by research and connects to detailed guidance in the playbook."

---

#### Part 3: What Else Is Here (2 minutes)

**[Quick navigation highlights - don't deep dive]**

**Governance & Compliance:**
> "For those dealing with EU regulations, we have comprehensive coverage of the EU AI Act, NIS2, GDPR integration, and digital sovereignty strategies."

**Human-Centric Adoption:**
> "This section addresses the 81% - change management frameworks, upskilling programs for HR, employee value propositions for the AI era."

**Adoption Engine:**
> "5-phase execution framework: Readiness Assessment, Use Case Prioritization, Roadmap Planning, Value Measurement, and Scaling to Production."

**[Show the Workshop Facilitator's Manual if time permits]**

> "We also have a complete 3-workshop program for facilitators who want to run hands-on sessions with their teams."

**Key Message:** "This isn't just documentation - it's a complete adoption system."

---

### Positioning: Why This Matters (2 minutes)

**[Close the demo, face the audience]**

> "What makes this different from vendor playbooks and consulting frameworks:
>
> 1. **Human-Centric:** Addresses the 81% failure factor - behavior change
> 2. **EU-Focused:** Tailored for European regulatory landscape
> 3. **Evidence-Based:** Built on 80+ research citations from 2024-2025
> 4. **Immediately Actionable:** Checklists, frameworks, workshop guides
> 5. **Open-Source:** Freely available, continuously updated, community-driven
>
> This is designed for people like you - business leaders who need practical guidance, not vendor pitches."

---

### Transition to Feedback (1 minute)

**[Hand out feedback forms or open discussion]**

> "I need your honest feedback. This is for you. I want to understand:
>
> - Does this address your real challenges?
> - What's missing that you need?
> - What would make you actually use this?
> - Would you recommend this to peers?
>
> Let's open it up. Tell me what you think."

## ANTICIPATE THESE QUESTIONS

### "How is this different from ChatGPT's advice or vendor playbooks?"

**Answer:**
> "Great question. Three differences: First, this is neutral - no vendor agenda. Second, it's human-centric - most playbooks focus on technology features. Third, it's EU-specific - we address the actual regulatory landscape you're navigating, not generic US-centric advice."

### "Is this only for Belgian/Flemish companies?"

**Answer:**
> "It's EU-focused, which makes it relevant across European markets. The compliance frameworks (EU AI Act, NIS2, GDPR) apply everywhere in the EU. The case studies and research draw from both Belgian and broader European sources."

### "What about ongoing support - is this just documentation?"

**Answer:**
> "The playbook includes workshop facilitation guides, so you can run sessions internally or with external support. I'm exploring what additional services would be valuable - that's part of why I want your feedback today. What kind of support would you need?"

### "How do you keep this current? AI moves fast."

**Answer:**
> "That's exactly why it's open-source and version-controlled. The base frameworks are durable - change management principles don't change monthly. But regulatory updates, new research, and case studies get added continuously. Think of it like Wikipedia for AI adoption - living documentation."

### "Why should I trust this over consulting firms?"

**Answer:**
> "You shouldn't blindly trust anything - including this. That's why everything is cited with 80+ research sources. You can verify the frameworks come from McKinsey, Gartner, Deloitte, EU regulations. The difference is this synthesizes it all into one place instead of selling you a project."

### "Do you have customer success stories or case studies?"

**Answer:**
> "That's one of the gaps I'm addressing in the next version. I have Flemish SMB adoption data and research, but I need more real implementation case studies. If any of you pilot this and succeed, I'd love to document your story - anonymized if needed."

### "What about specific industries - is this generic?"

**Answer:**
> "The frameworks are industry-agnostic by design because the human factors (change management, governance, shadow AI) are universal. But the use case prioritization section helps you contextualize to your industry. Industry-specific deep dives could be a community contribution opportunity."

## ENERGY & DELIVERY TIPS

### Tone
- **Confident but humble:** You're presenting research, not selling
- **Conversational:** This is a feedback session, not a pitch
- **Curious:** You genuinely want their input
- **Pragmatic:** Focus on "does this help?" not "isn't this amazing?"

### Pacing
- **Slow down on statistics:** Let impact numbers land
- **Speed up on navigation:** Don't dwell on UI, focus on content
- **Pause for reactions:** Watch their faces, invite questions
- **Listen actively:** Take notes on feedback, don't defend

### Body Language
- Maintain eye contact (not just screen)
- Use hand gestures to emphasize key points
- Nod when they speak to show you're listening
- Smile when appropriate (this is for them)

### Red Flags to Watch For
- **Glazed eyes:** You're talking too much, invite interaction
- **Skeptical faces:** Address skepticism directly, ask "what's your concern?"
- **Phone checking:** Content isn't resonating, pivot to what matters to them
- **Silence after questions:** Rephrase, give permission to be critical

## WORST-CASE SCENARIO PLANS

### Tech Fails (Site Won't Load)
- **Backup:** Use this script to walk through content verbally
- **Backup 2:** Share screen with source Markdown files
- **Backup 3:** Focus entirely on discussion and feedback, show content later

### Time Runs Short
- **Priority 1:** Business Owner Checklist deep dive (7 min)
- **Priority 2:** Feedback questions (10 min)
- **Skip:** Full site navigation, workshop manual, detailed sections

### Hostile/Skeptical Audience
- **Acknowledge:** "I appreciate the skepticism - the AI hype cycle has created fatigue"
- **Focus:** "Let me show you the most practical piece and you tell me if it's useful"
- **Invite criticism:** "What would you need to see to find this credible?"

### They Love It Too Much (Over-Promise Risk)
- **Manage expectations:** "This is v1.0 - there are gaps I'm actively addressing"
- **Be honest:** "Interactive tools and more case studies are coming in v1.1"
- **Focus feedback:** "What matters most for your immediate needs?"
