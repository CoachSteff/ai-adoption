# The Open-Source AI Adoption Playbook

## A Human-Centric Blueprint for Enterprises: Moving Beyond Experimentation to Scale, Value, and Compliance

### Executive Summary: The 2025 AI Mandate

Enterprise AI adoption in late 2025 is defined by a critical paradox: near-universal experimentation coexists with catastrophic failure rates in value realization.1 This "GenAI Divide" 2 is staggering, with 95% of organizations reporting zero measurable return on investment 2 and 42% now abandoning the majority of their AI projects before they ever reach production.3

This is not a technology failure; it is a human adoption failure. The primary barriers are a lack of executive leadership and vision 4 and a systemic failure to manage the "human element" 5—the organizational change, talent upskilling, and cultural adaptation required. For European enterprises, this challenge is compounded by a complex, high-stakes regulatory landscape defined by the EU AI Act, NIS2, and GDPR 7, alongside a strategic mandate for "Digital Sovereignty".10

This report provides the open-source framework to bridge this chasm. It re-frames AI adoption as a change management and organizational design challenge. It provides the actionable governance models (Part 2), human capital frameworks (Part 3), and scalable execution engine (Part 4) to navigate this transformation. It concludes with role-specific checklists (Part 5) to move from haphazard pilots to industrialized, responsible, and value-driven AI.

## Part 1: The 2025 Mandate: Bridging the AI Value Chasm

This section diagnoses the primary failure mode of AI adoption: the gap between universal hype and near-zero value. It establishes that the root cause is not technology, but a failure of leadership, strategy, and a focus on the wrong metrics.

### 1.1 The Great Disconnect: Analyzing the "GenAI Divide"

The core challenge of 2025 is the "Pilot-to-Production Chasm." Despite the "GenAI Scramble" 12, enterprises are failing to industrialize value. The data is conclusive:

- IDC analysis shows that in Europe, only 13% of AI proofs-of-concept (PoCs) built in 2023-2024 have successfully made it into production.10
- MLQ/NANDA research reveals a "GenAI Divide" where 95% of organizations are getting zero return from a collective $30-40 billion in enterprise investment.2
- S&P Global reports that 42% of companies now abandon the majority of their AI initiatives before production. This failure rate has surged from 17% the previous year, indicating the problem is accelerating.3
- McKinsey confirms this, stating that nearly two-thirds of organizations have not begun scaling AI, and only 39% report any level of EBIT impact at the enterprise level.1

A critical disconnect exists between vendor-reported usage and analyst-reported value. Tech vendors like Microsoft report high "adoption," stating "85% of the Fortune 500 using Microsoft AI solutions".13 However, 80% of respondents in a recent McKinsey survey report "little to no bottom-line impact" from these tools.6

This is a "vanity metric" crisis. The increase in the failure rate from 17% to 42% 3 demonstrates that the current "rush to capitalize" 3 is the cause of the failure. Organizations are engaging in "haphazard prototyping" 15 and skipping the foundational work of strategy, governance, and human-centric design. Executives are being misled by tracking tool usage (e.g., "How many people use our Copilot?") instead of value (e.g., "What is the P&L impact of our AI initiatives?").16

### 1.2 The Leadership Barrier: The True Bottleneck to Scale

The single biggest barrier to scaling AI is not technology, cost, or employee resistance. It is a systemic failure of leadership.

- McKinsey reports conclude: "The biggest barrier to success is not employees—who are ready—but leaders, who are not steering fast enough".4 A mere 1% of leaders describe their AI rollouts as "mature".17
- Prosci's 2025 study on adoption challenges attributes 43% of all failures to "Leadership alignment and organizational resistance".19

A dangerous contradiction is paralyzing organizations. A 2025 report reveals 42% of executives believe GenAI is "tearing their companies apart".20 In the same report, 97% of those same executives admit they personally benefit from AI in their daily work.20

This "Do as I say, not as I do" crisis reveals that leaders are using AI for personal productivity gains but are failing to do the hard work of building an enterprise-wide strategy for it. This leadership vacuum is the direct cause of the chaos 20 and the reason "Shadow AI" (see Part 3.4) thrives—employees are forced to innovate on their own, as leaders are not leading.4

### 1.3 The "Human-Centric" Imperative: Reframing the Problem

The query's premise is correct: this is a "human behaviour" problem. Prosci's data shows 38% of AI adoption challenges stem from "insufficient training".19 When combined with the 43% for "leadership alignment," this means 81% of all adoption failures are purely human-centric.19

Edelman's research confirms this, noting, "When adopting generative AI... one of the most overlooked factors is the most foundational, the human element".5 Deloitte states the gap is in "strategy, trust and adoption in the workplace".21

Successful adoption in 2025 requires a shift from "AI-First" (forcing people to use technology) to "Human-First".22 This "Humanity AI" approach means designing systems that "adapt to people rather than forcing people to adapt to technology".22

The data overwhelmingly shows that the technology-first approach is the direct cause of the 95% failure rate.2 The solution lies in mastering governance, human-centric change, and a value-driven roadmap.

## Part 2: The EU-Centric Foundation: Governance, Trust, and Sovereignty

This section provides the non-negotiable governance scaffolding for any EU enterprise. This is not "red tape"; it is the enabling framework that builds trust, manages risk, and unlocks sustainable adoption.

### 2.1 Navigating the EU AI Act: A Practical Compliance Path

The EU AI Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689) 23 is in force, establishing a risk-based pyramid 9:

- Unacceptable Risk: Banned (e.g., social scoring).
- High-Risk: Strictly regulated (e.g., CV-sorting software 7, credit scoring 7, biometric ID).
- Limited Risk: Subject to transparency (e.g., chatbots).
- Minimal Risk: Largely unregulated.

The deadlines are immediate. Prohibitions on unacceptable AI took effect in February 2025. The crucial governance rules and obligations for General-Purpose AI (GPAI) models became applicable in August 2025.7

A practical 6-point compliance action plan includes 24:

1. Establishing a complete AI inventory with risk classification.
2. Clarifying the company's role (supplier, modifier, or deployer).
3. Preparing the necessary technical and transparency documentation.
4. Implementing copyright and data protection requirements.
5. Training and verifying AI competence among all employees.
6. Adapting internal governance structures (e.g., appointing responsible persons).

However, a massive gap exists between this law and enterprise reality. 46 European companies have pleaded with the Commission for a two-year pause, citing "reasonable implementation" challenges.25 This gap is exacerbated by the "Shadow AI" phenomenon (see Part 3.4), which makes a "complete AI inventory" 24 nearly impossible.4

The actionable path forward is to use available "how-to" tools:

1. Use NIST AI RMF for EU AI Act Compliance: The EU AI Act is the law (the "what"), but the US-based NIST AI Risk Management Framework (RMF) is the voluntary process (the "how").26 It provides the clear roadmap to build the exact risk management systems the EU Act mandates.27
2. Adopt the GPAI Code of Practice: This is a voluntary tool to demonstrate compliance for transparency, copyright, and safety, reducing the administrative burden.7
3. Deploy the AI Act Compliance Checker: This official tool 28 is designed specifically for SMEs to understand their legal obligations.31

### 2.2 Gartner's AI TRiSM Framework: The Technical Governance Engine

AI Trust, Risk, and Security Management (TRiSM) is a foundational enabler for sustainable AI.32 It is the technical and procedural solution to manage the risks 33 that the EU AI Act regulates.

The 4-Layer Framework is a layered system 34:

1. AI Governance: (Offline) Setting policies, inventorying models, mapping to risks. This directly supports the EU AI Act's "AI Inventory" requirement.24
2. AI Runtime Inspection & Enforcement: (Real-time) Actively monitoring AI interactions to enforce policies at runtime.
3. Information Governance: Applying data classification and protection to AI models, connecting to GDPR.
4. Infrastructure & Stack: Securing the underlying platforms, pipelines, and ModelOps (see Part 4.5).

A policy (Layer 1) alone is a failure. Gartner predicts 80% of unauthorized AI transactions will be from internal policy violations 36, and "Shadow AI" is now a Top 5 emerging risk.37 Therefore, "AI Governance" (Layer 1) must be paired with "AI Runtime Inspection" (Layer 2) to catch internal violations and detect shadow AI.

### 2.3 Integrating Cyber-Resilience: AI as part of the NIS2 Directive

AI systems are software. This means in addition to the EU AI Act, they fall under the EU's NIS2 Directive's 38 cybersecurity risk management rules, particularly:

- Supply Chain Security: 8 When an enterprise buys an AI service (e.g., from OpenAI, Microsoft), that vendor is part of the supply chain. NIS2 requires the enterprise to vet the vendor's "cybersecurity practices," including their secure development procedures.39
- Security in Acquisitions: 8 When an enterprise acquires a new AI platform, it must define security requirements in the technical specifications.

The CAIO and CTO must create a unified procurement policy. They cannot assess a new AI tool only for EU AI Act risk; they must simultaneously assess it for NIS2 supply chain risk.

### 2.4 The Sovereignty Strategy: Mitigating "Big Tech" Over-dependence

A growing C-suite-level concern 10 is Europe's over-dependence on US hyperscalers. Amazon, Microsoft, and Google control over 80% of the EU's IaaS market.11 This is not just about data location. As analysis from 2025 notes, "Even if data is physically located in Europe, a US court ruling can lead to closure".40

The EU's strategic response is "Sovereign Cloud." Gartner defines this as cloud services ensuring "data, operational, and technological control".11 This market is projected to grow at an 86% CAGR, from 10% market share in 2024 to 47% by 2028.11 While US hyperscalers are responding with products like the "Microsoft Sovereign Cloud" 41, sovereignty is no longer just risk mitigation; it is a competitive advantage.42 An EU enterprise that builds its AI services on a true sovereign cloud 40 can use this "trust" as a key differentiator to win EU customers.

### 2.5 Governing Agentic AI: The New Frontier of Risk

Agentic AI—autonomous systems that can make decisions and take actions—is being rapidly adopted. 62% of organizations are already experimenting.1 This is happening without regulatory frameworks; reports note that "gaps remain for autonomous systems".43

To prevent catastrophic risk, all agentic AI pilots must be governed by a framework. Deloitte's 6-point model provides the playbook standard 44:

1. Role-Based Design: Assign agents to specific roles to reduce complexity.
2. Domain Tailoring: Specialize agents for specific business areas.
3. Balance Responsibilities: Avoid bottlenecks or governance chaos.
4. Controlled Access: (Most Critical) Limit agents to essential tools, data, and skills only.
5. Prioritize Feedback: Design for human-in-the-loop oversight.
6. Embrace Reinvention: Allow agents to transform processes, not just automate them.

## Part 3: The Human-Centric Operating Model: Change, Talent, and the New EVP

AI doesn't fail because the model is wrong; it fails because the new workflow is wrong, the training is missing, and the human is an afterthought. This section details the core "human behavior" elements of adoption.

### 3.1 Redefining the Employee Value Proposition (EVP) for the AI Era

The worker-employer relationship is being rewritten by AI. The stakes are high: over 70% of managers and workers are "more likely to join and stay with" a company if its EVP helps them thrive in an AI-driven world.21 Leaders must navigate the tensions between "automation vs. augmentation" and "control vs. empowerment".47

Deloitte's 2025 Global Human Capital Trends warn that AI, while automating rote work, is having "silent, unintended impacts".46 These include 46:

- Burnout & Difficulty: AI handles easy tasks, leaving humans with only the most complex, "hardest tasks," increasing burnout.
- Loneliness & Isolation: AI reduces person-to-person interaction.
- Loss of Agency: AI reduces human decision-making.
- Loss of Learning: AI automates the "entry-level" tasks, removing the "training ground" for new employees.

A framework for the new "Human-AI Value Proposition" must be proactive 46:

1. Study the Impacts: Use "anthropological research," surveys, and focus groups to find the silent impacts.
2. Share the AI Plan: Be transparent. Explain how AI will be used to augment, not just replace.
3. Forge the HR-Tech Partnership: The CHRO and CTO must co-own this. New roles like "Chief Human and Machine Resource Officer" are being considered.46
4. Share the Rewards: The EVP must answer, "How will workers share in the value AI creates?"
5. Enable Reciprocal Learning: The EVP must guarantee new learning opportunities to compensate for those lost to automation.46
6. Empower Experimentation: Provide AI tools and the psychological safety to use them.

### 3.2 A Playbook for Change Management

AI adoption is an "emotional transition," not a software update.5 Leaders must "acknowledge those emotional bonds" a 20-year veteran has to their old processes.5

McKinsey's "Rewired" playbook 1 provides the execution model for this change. The key elements are:

1. Vision and Roadmap: Create a "compelling change story" 18 and "shared vision of opportunity" 1 that employees can rally behind.
2. Talent: The upskilling plan (see 3.3).
3. Operating Model: The redesign of workflows and business processes.1
4. Data and AI: The governance and platforms (see Part 2).
5. Technology: The scalable infrastructure (see Part 4.5).

AI change management is not a step in the project; it is the project. The "Rewired" framework 4 is the structure for the entire AI transformation.

### 3.3 The HRBP's 6-Step Upskilling Framework

The AI skills gap is a top-3 barrier to adoption.50 While 90% of CHROs know this 51 and 75% are changing their talent strategies 52, the execution is failing. According to HR.com, only 21% of HR professionals rate their L&D efforts as "high quality." They know upskilling is urgent, but "their current programs aren't ready for the future".53

To fix this, HR must lead a strategic workforce transformation 54:

1. Map Roles: Identify which roles will be streamlined vs. enhanced.
2. Assess the Skills Gap: Use surveys and AI-driven analytics to map existing skills against future needs.
3. Develop a Taxonomy of Skills: Define the crucial new skills (e.g., prompt engineering, data literacy, AI ethics, human-AI collaboration).
4. Design & Deploy Training: Create role-based, tailored training programs 18, not one-size-fits-all.
5. Measure Efficacy: Track skills acquisition and application.
6. Iterate Continuously: This is not a one-time project; it's a new, continuous function of HR.56

### 3.4 Harnessing "Shadow AI": A 4-Step Management Playbook

"Shadow AI" refers to the unsanctioned use of AI tools by employees.57 The problem is far bigger than most leaders realize:

- Prevalence: Employees are 3x more likely to be using GenAI for daily work than their C-suite leaders believe.4
- Velocity: In some industries, Shadow AI usage is up 250% year over year.58
- Risk: It is now a Top 5 Emerging Risk for enterprises, according to Gartner.37

Unsanctioned, unvetted tools create massive exposure 57, including data leaks (employees feeding proprietary source code into public models 61), IP loss, and violations of GDPR and the EU AI Act.61

However, Shadow AI is a symptom of a leadership and tooling failure. Employees turn to these tools because they are "frustrated with existing tools".57 Banning it is "not realistic" 63 and will only drive it deeper underground. It is a clear, bottom-up signal of unmet user needs.

The solution is not restriction; it's guidance. This 4-step management playbook can turn the risk into an opportunity 63:

1. Establish an AI-Acceptable Use Policy: (The Boundaries) Define which tools are approved and what data can be used.
2. Train and Educate: (The "Why") Teach teams why this is a risk. Most employees "don't realize they're creating risk".63
3. Monitor and Audit: (The Visibility) Use Data Loss Prevention (DLP) and Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASBs) to detect unauthorized usage.63 This connects directly to the TRiSM Layer 2 (see Part 2.2).
4. Support Innovation Within a Framework: (The Opportunity) Provide a simple, accessible process for employees to request new AI tools. "When it's too hard to innovate within the system, they'll innovate outside of it".63

## Part 4: The Adoption Engine: From Readiness to Scaled Industrialization

This section provides the 5-phase execution engine for moving from an ad-hoc, chaotic state to a mature, value-driven "AI factory."

### 4.1 Phase 1: Readiness Assessment (Where Are We?)

Before building a roadmap, an organization must know its starting point.64 An AI Maturity Model is a strategic tool to assess "technology, data, processes, and people".64 The framework below synthesizes leading models from Gartner 65, MITRE 66, and Guidehouse 67 into one actionable assessment tool.

### Table 4.1: The Consolidated AI Maturity Assessment Tool

| Maturity Level              | 1. Strategy & Vision                                      | 2. Governance & Responsible AI                                                                                  | 3. Data Readiness                                                 | 4. People & Culture                                                      | 5. Technology & Engineering                                          | 6. Performance & Value                                            |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Level 1: Initial/Ad Hoc     | No formal AI strategy. Siloed experiments.                | No formal governance. "Shadow AI" is rampant. EU AI Act/NIS2 risks are unmanaged.                               | Data is siloed, poor quality, and not "AI-ready".68               | "AI-fear" is common. No formal upskilling. Change is resisted.19         | No dedicated AI infrastructure. Ad-hoc "build vs. buy" decisions.    | Value is not tracked. Projects are "science experiments".15       |
| Level 2: Foundational       | Basic AI ambitions defined.56 Focus on "quick wins."      | Initial principles (e.g., ethics) defined. AI inventory started.24                                              | Data readiness for initial use cases is assessed.56               | Basic AI literacy programs. Pockets of "AI champions" exist.             | Sandbox environment for experimentation is established.56            | Value is tracked for individual pilots, focused on "hours saved." |
| Level 3: Systematic/Defined | Formal AI strategy linked to business goals.              | Formal governance structure (e.g., AI steering committee). TRiSM is being deployed.34                           | Data governance adapted for AI. Data quality is actively managed. | Role-based upskilling (Part 3.3) is in place. Change mgt. plan exists.56 | "Build vs. buy" criteria are defined. Reference architecture exists. | KPIs are defined.18 ROI, ROE, and ROF are considered.55           |
| Level 4: Differentiating    | AI is a C-suite priority, used for competitive advantage. | Governance is automated via TRiSM (Layer 2) and ModelOps (Part 4.5). Compliance (e.g., EU AI Act) is auditable. | AI-ready data is a centralized, reliable corporate asset.         | "Human-AI collaboration" is a defined competency. New EVP is active.46   | A formal ModelOps "factory" 69 is scaling AI reliably.               | Value is systematically tracked and linked to enterprise EBIT.1   |
| Level 5: Transformational   | AI is "fully integrated" 70, reshaping business models.   | Responsible AI is a cultural norm and competitive differentiator.42                                             | Data, AI, and business strategy are fully converged.              | Continuous reciprocal learning (human & AI). Culture is adaptive.56      | AI platform engineering is a core, continuous business function.56   | AI drives measurable, sustainable business transformation.        |

### 4.2 Phase 2: Strategic Prioritization (What Do We Do First?)

The goal is to move "from chasing AI use cases to using AI to fulfill business strategy".70 A toolkit of prioritization frameworks exists 71, and the choice of framework depends on the maturity identified in Phase 1.

- Low Maturity (Level 1-2): Start simple. Use OpenAI's "Impact/Effort" matrix 71 to find "Quick wins" and build momentum.
- Medium Maturity (Level 3): Get more specific. Use Google's "Value / Actionability / Feasibility" matrix 71 to triage a large backlog of ideas.
- High Maturity (Level 4-5): Get strategic. Use Deloitte's "Differentiability Index" 71 or BCG's "Task Automatability" analysis 71 to find true, long-term competitive advantage.

### Table 4.2: Comparative AI Use Case Prioritization Models

| Framework / Source | Key Axes / Method                              | Best For (Maturity Stage)                                                                             |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OpenAI 71          | Impact vs. Effort                              | Low Maturity: Identifying "Quick Wins" to build momentum and prove initial value.                     |
| Google 71          | Value vs. Actionability vs. Feasibility        | Medium Maturity: Triaging a large backlog of potential use cases with a balanced view.                |
| Anthropic 71       | Data, Success Metrics, and ROI                 | Medium Maturity: Ensuring pilots are measurable and built on available data.                          |
| KPMG 71            | Value vs. Complexity                           | Low-Medium Maturity: A simple, high-level matrix for executive-level planning.                        |
| Deloitte 71        | "Differentiability Index"                      | High Maturity: Finding transformative use cases that provide unique, long-term competitive advantage. |
| BCG 71             | Task Automatability & Cost Reduction Potential | High Maturity: Deep, process-level analysis for large-scale transformation and efficiency.            |

### 4.3 Phase 3: Building the Roadmap (How Do We Get There?)

"Establishing a clearly defined road map" has one of the biggest impacts on EBIT.18 Gartner's 7-Workstream AI Roadmap 56 is the most comprehensive, human-centric model:

1. AI Strategy: The "why" and "where".56
2. AI Value: The use case portfolio and ROI.56
3. AI Organization: The operating model, teams, and partnerships.56
4. AI People & Culture: The upskilling and change plan (see Part 3).56
5. AI Governance: The trust, risk, and compliance framework (see Part 2).56
6. AI Engineering: The scalable platforms and ModelOps.56
7. AI Data: The data quality, governance, and readiness.56

These 7 workstreams must be run in parallel. The primary reason pilots fail to scale 15 is that organizations only focus on Workstream 6 (Engineering) and 7 (Data) during the pilot, and forget 1-5 (Strategy, People, Governance) until it is too late.

### 4.4 Phase 4: Measuring True Value (Was It Worth It?)

This is the "AI Measurement Crisis." "Tracking well-defined KPIs" has the #1 most impact on EBIT 18, yet less than 20% of organizations actually do it.72 The reason is that "AI ROI can be difficult to quantify" using traditional, short-term financial models.73

To solve this, Gartner proposes a multi-dimensional framework that moves beyond simple ROI 55:

- Return on Investment (ROI): Traditional financial metrics (e.g., Cost Savings, Revenue Growth).76
- Return on Employee (ROE): (The Human Metric) Measures impact on employee experience, productivity, and retention.55 This directly measures the mitigation of the "silent impacts" (see Part 3.1).46
- Return on Future (ROF): (The Strategic Metric) Measures long-term strategic benefits, innovation capacity, and "right to play".55

A key part of measurement is Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). TCO for GenAI "can often exceed initial expectations due to hidden costs" 55 like compliance reviews, retraining, and overhead. A successful 2025 AI program must track all three.

### 4.5 Phase 5: Scaling from Pilot to Production (The "AI Factory")

This is the final step in bridging the chasm. 95% of pilots fail to scale 78, and Gartner predicts 30% of GenAI projects will be abandoned after PoC in 2025.15 The root cause: leaders use pilots as "technology experiments" instead of "implementation preparation".15

The solution involves two key components:

1. The "Agility at Scale" 5-Step Framework 79:
2. Align pilots to Business KPIs (not just technical metrics).
3. Build Scalable Infrastructure (MLOps/ModelOps).
4. Establish Robust Data Governance.
5. Upskill Talent for Production Support (not just R&D).
6. Roll Out Incrementally with Feedback Loops.
7. The "ModelOps" Engine: Model Operationalization (ModelOps) is the foundational discipline for scaling.68 It is the "AI factory" 56—an automated, governed, and repeatable process for "end-to-end governance and life cycle management" 68 of all AI models.

## Part 5: The Open-Source Playbook: Actionable Checklists for Executive Stakeholders

This section translates the report's frameworks into actionable, role-based checklists.

### 5.1 Comparative Analysis: Tech Vendor Hype vs. Enterprise Reality

Vendor playbooks are often dangerously incomplete. They focus on technical "how-to" and "start now" 80 while completely omitting the human and organizational prerequisites (governance, change management) that analysts 3 identify as the primary causes of failure.

### Table 5.1: Vendor Hype vs. Enterprise Reality Check

| Vendor Claim / Playbook                               | Enterprise Reality / Pitfall (The "Why it Fails")                                                      | The 2025 Playbook Recommendation                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OpenAI: "Lesson 7: Set bold automation goals" 80      | Reality: This "rush to capitalize" 3 is why 42% of projects are abandoned. It skips strategy.          | Playbook: Start with Readiness (4.1) and Prioritization (4.2). Link every pilot to a business KPI.79                                     |
| Microsoft: "Enriching employee experiences" 13        | Reality: AI is also creating "silent impacts" like burnout, loneliness, and loss of agency.[46, 49]    | Playbook: You must proactively design a new EVP for the AI Era (3.1) to mitigate these human-centric risks.                              |
| Google: "Focus on sustainable costs" [81]             | Reality: TCO is "exceeding initial expectations" due to hidden costs like compliance and retraining.55 | Playbook: Track costs with a true TCO model and measure value with ROE and ROF, not just simple ROI (4.4).                               |
| OpenAI: "Lesson 5: Get AI in the hands of experts" 80 | Reality: Employees are already doing this ("Shadow AI"). 38% are sharing confidential data.61          | Playbook: This is a governance and training problem first. Implement the 4-Step Shadow AI Plan (3.4) before you empower experimentation. |

### 5.2 Actionable Checklist for the CAIO / CTO

- Governance & Compliance (Part 2):
  - [ ] Have you used the AI Act Compliance Checker 28 to triage all existing AI systems?
