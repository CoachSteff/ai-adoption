# **About Steff Vanhaverbeke**

## Your Guide to Being Irreplaceable in the Age of AI

Steff Vanhaverbeke is on a mission to make you irreplaceable in the age of AI. She’s a veteran business coach and change facilitator who got her start as a computer nerd designing for the early web. Steff sees a world drifting toward automation and losing its human touch—and she's here to stop it. Her powerful new book, **“BEING REPLACED,”** introduces her game-changing **Cognitive Agility Framework**. Steff passionately believes the future doesn't need us to be faster; it needs us to be braver. She’s here to show you how to stop competing with machines and start doing the work that only a human can.

### Steff's Philosophy

The future of work isn't a race against the machine; it's a journey back to what makes us human. As AI handles routine tasks, our value shifts from efficiency to presence. The new bottom line is measured by the quality of our insights, the strength of our connections, and the wisdom of our decisions. My work is dedicated to helping professionals and organizations master this shift and thrive.

### **The Cognitive Agility Framework**

The **Cognitive Agility Framework (CAF)** is a practical system for mastering the five core human skills that technology cannot automate.

- **Flexible Thinking**: Adapt your mindset to see solutions where others see problems.
- **Emotional Intelligence**: Build the trust and psychological safety that drive real performance.
- **Collaborative Intelligence**: Move beyond simple coordination to solve complex challenges together.
- **Intuition**: Learn to trust the "quiet data" of your embodied experience to make wiser decisions.
- **Innovation**: Create the conditions for new ideas to emerge, even in systems that resist change.
