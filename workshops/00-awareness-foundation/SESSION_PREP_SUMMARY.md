## Your Talking Points (Memorize These)

### Opening Hook
> "95% of AI initiatives deliver zero ROI. 42% are abandoned within 12 months. 81% of failures are caused by human factors, not technology. This isn't a technology problem—it's a human behavior problem."

### Differentiation
> "This is human-centric, not tech-centric. EU-focused with comprehensive compliance coverage. Evidence-based with 80+ research citations. Immediately actionable with checklists and frameworks. And it's completely open-source—freely available to everyone."

### Business Owner Checklist
> "Notice we don't just say 'prioritize use cases'—we give you 6 frameworks based on maturity level. We don't just say 'measure ROI'—we give you ROI plus ROE plus ROF. We don't just say 'deal with Shadow AI'—we give you a 4-step constructive management plan."

### Transition to Feedback
> "I need your honest feedback. Does this address your real challenges? What's missing that you need? What would make you actually use this Monday morning?"
