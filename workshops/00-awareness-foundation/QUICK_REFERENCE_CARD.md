## ANTICIPATED QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

**Q: How is this different from vendor playbooks?**
A: "Neutral—no vendor agenda. Human-centric—most focus on tech features. EU-specific—actual regulatory landscape you're navigating."

**Q: Is this only for Belgian/Flemish companies?**
A: "EU-focused, relevant across Europe. Compliance frameworks apply everywhere in EU. Research draws from Belgian and broader European sources."

**Q: What about ongoing support?**
A: "Includes workshop facilitation guides. Exploring what additional services would be valuable—that's part of why I want your feedback. What support would you need?"

**Q: How do you keep this current?**
A: "Open-source and version-controlled. Base frameworks are durable. Regulatory updates and research added continuously. Like Wikipedia for AI adoption."

**Q: Why trust this over consulting firms?**
A: "Everything is cited with 80+ research sources. You can verify frameworks come from McKinsey, Gartner, Deloitte. This synthesizes it all instead of selling you a project."
