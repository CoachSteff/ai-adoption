## Facilitation Guide

### Opening (5-10 minutes)

**Hook (Memorize This):**
> "Thank you for being here. I want to start with three numbers: 95% of AI initiatives deliver zero ROI. 42% are abandoned within 12 months. 81% of failures are caused by human factors, not technology. This isn't a technology problem—it's a human behavior problem."

**Frame the Session:**
- This is about YOUR needs, not selling
- I need your honest feedback
- Let's explore whether this addresses real challenges
- Your input shapes the next version

**Set Expectations:**
- 15-20 min demo
- 10-15 min structured feedback
- All materials provided
- Follow-up resources shared after

---

### Core Presentation (30-40 minutes)

#### Part 1: The Problem (5-7 min)
- **Statistics:** 95%, 42%, 81% (pause for impact)
- **Root cause:** Human factors, not technology
- **Evidence:** McKinsey, Gartner, Deloitte research

**Key Message:** "AI adoption is a change management challenge, not a technical integration problem."

---

#### Part 2: Live Playbook Demo (10-15 min)

**Site Navigation (quick):**
1. Homepage → Show 5 main sections
2. Emphasize: Organized by business needs, not technology

**Key Sections Highlight:**
- Getting Started → The mandate
- Governance & Compliance → EU-specific (AI Act, NIS2)
- Human-Centric Adoption → The 81% factor
- Adoption Engine → 5-phase framework
- Checklists & Templates → Actionable tools

**Demo Tip:** Navigate smoothly, don't get lost in details, keep momentum.

---

#### Part 3: Business Owner Checklist (10-15 min)

**Deep Dive on 4 Sections:**

**1. Value & Prioritization (3 min)**
- Align AI to business strategy (not chase use cases)
- Use formal prioritization frameworks
- Every pilot tied to business KPI

**Example to highlight:**
> "Most organizations let vendors define use cases. This checklist flips it: you map your business needs first, then find AI solutions."

---

**2. Measurement & ROI (3 min)**
- Track multi-dimensional KPIs
- ROI + ROE + ROF framework
- Establish baselines before rollout

**Example to highlight:**
> "We don't just say 'measure ROI.' We give you three dimensions: Return on Investment (financial), Return on Employee (people), Return on Future (innovation)."

---

**3. Shadow AI Management (3 min)**
- 60-80% of employees use unauthorized AI
- 4-step constructive management plan
- Policy, train, monitor, innovate

**Example to highlight:**
> "Shadow AI is happening in your organization right now. This gives you a framework to manage it constructively, not punitively."

---

**4. Leadership & Communication (3 min)**
- Executive engagement is #1 predictor
- Compelling change story
- Regular communication and celebration

**Demo Tip:** Use real checkbox examples. Show how each connects to detailed guidance.

---

#### Part 4: Positioning (5 min)

1. **Human-centric** (not tech-centric)
2. **EU-focused** (comprehensive compliance)
3. **Evidence-based** (80+ citations, 2024-2025)
4. **Immediately actionable** (checklists, not theory)
5. **Open-source** (free, community-driven)

**Proof Points:**

- McKinsey, Gartner, Deloitte frameworks
- Workshop facilitation guides included
- Active development and updates

---

### Transition to Feedback (2 minutes)

**Set the Stage:**
> "I need your honest feedback. This is for YOU. I want to understand:
> - Does this address your real challenges?
> - What's missing that you need?
> - What would make you actually use this?
> - What would increase your confidence and trust?"

**Invite Open Discussion:**
> "Let's open it up. Tell me what you think. Be critical—that's the most valuable feedback."

## Common Questions & Answers

### "How is this different from ChatGPT's advice?"
**Answer:** "Three differences: First, neutral—no vendor agenda. Second, human-centric—focuses on behavior change, not just tech. Third, EU-specific—addresses real regulatory landscape."

### "Is this only for tech companies?"
**Answer:** "No—frameworks are universal because human factors (change management, governance) apply across all industries. Use case prioritization helps you contextualize to your sector."

### "What about ongoing support?"
**Answer:** "Workshop facilitation guides included for internal use. We're exploring what additional services would be valuable—that's why I want your feedback. What would you need?"

### "How current is this?"
**Answer:** "Built on 2024-2025 research. Open-source so regulatory updates, new research, case studies get added continuously. Living documentation, not one-time delivery."

### "Do you have success stories?"
**Answer:** "That's a gap we're addressing. I have Flemish SMB data and research, but need more implementation case studies. If you pilot this, I'd love to document your story."
