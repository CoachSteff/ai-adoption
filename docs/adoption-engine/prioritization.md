# Strategic Prioritization: Choosing the Right AI Use Cases

## The Core Challenge

The goal is to move **"from chasing AI use cases to using AI to fulfill business strategy"**.

Many organizations have dozens or hundreds of potential AI use cases. The challenge is selecting which ones to pursue first.

## Maturity-Based Framework Selection

The choice of prioritization framework depends on your organization's AI maturity:

### Low Maturity (Level 1-2)
**Focus:** Build momentum with quick wins

**Recommended:** Simple impact/effort matrices

**Why:**
- Limited resources and experience
- Need to prove value quickly
- Build confidence and capability
- Learn the basics

### Medium Maturity (Level 3)
**Focus:** Balance quick wins with strategic value

**Recommended:** Multi-dimensional assessment

**Why:**
- Growing portfolio of opportunities
- Need systematic triage
- Balance competing priorities
- Manage resource allocation

### High Maturity (Level 4-5)
**Focus:** Transformational competitive advantage

**Recommended:** Strategic differentiation analysis

**Why:**
- Sustained competitive advantage
- Long-term strategic positioning
- Complex transformation programs
- Market leadership

## Comparative Prioritization Models

### For Low Maturity: OpenAI Impact/Effort Matrix
