# Phase 1: Readiness Assessment (Where Are We?)

Before building a roadmap, an organization must know its starting point. An AI Maturity Model is a strategic tool to assess "technology, data, processes, and people."

## Why Assessment Matters

You cannot plan effectively without understanding:
- Your current AI capabilities
- Gaps in technology, data, processes, and people
- Your position relative to industry benchmarks
- Where to focus improvement efforts

## The Consolidated AI Maturity Assessment Tool

This framework synthesizes leading models from Gartner, MITRE, and Guidehouse into one actionable assessment tool.

### Assessment Dimensions

1. **Strategy & Vision**
2. **Governance & Responsible AI**
3. **Data Readiness**
4. **People & Culture**
5. **Technology & Engineering**
6. **Performance & Value**

### Maturity Levels

#### Level 1: Initial/Ad Hoc
- No formal AI strategy
- No formal governance
- Data is siloed and poor quality
- "AI-fear" is common
- No dedicated AI infrastructure
- Value is not tracked

#### Level 2: Foundational
- Basic AI ambitions defined
- Initial principles defined
- Data readiness assessed for initial use cases
- Basic AI literacy programs
- Sandbox environment established
- Value tracked for individual pilots

#### Level 3: Systematic/Defined
- Formal AI strategy linked to business goals
- Formal governance structure (AI steering committee)
- Data governance adapted for AI
- Role-based upskilling in place
- "Build vs. buy" criteria defined
- KPIs defined (ROI, ROE, ROF considered)

#### Level 4: Differentiating
- AI is a C-suite priority
- Governance automated via TRiSM and ModelOps
- AI-ready data is a centralized asset
- "Human-AI collaboration" is a defined competency
- Formal ModelOps "factory" scaling AI
- Value systematically tracked and linked to EBIT

#### Level 5: Transformational
- AI is "fully integrated," reshaping business models
- Responsible AI is a cultural norm
- Data, AI, and business strategy fully converged
- Continuous reciprocal learning (human & AI)
- AI platform engineering is a core business function
- AI drives measurable, sustainable transformation

## How to Conduct the Assessment

### Step 1: Assemble Assessment Team
Include representatives from:
- Executive leadership
- IT/Technology
- Data/Analytics
- HR/Talent
- Business units
- Risk/Compliance

### Step 2: Evaluate Each Dimension
For each of the 6 dimensions, assess your organization against the 5 maturity levels.

**Questions to ask**:
- What is our current state for this dimension?
- What evidence supports this assessment?
- What are the gaps between current and desired state?
- What would Level 3 (Systematic) look like for us?

### Step 3: Document Findings
Create a maturity profile showing:
- Current level for each dimension
- Gaps and opportunities
- Quick wins vs. long-term improvements
- Dependencies between dimensions

### Step 4: Prioritize Improvements
Based on assessment results:
- Identify critical gaps blocking progress
- Find quick wins to build momentum
- Plan longer-term capability building
- Align improvements with business priorities

## Assessment Template

Use this template to document your assessment:

```markdown
## Strategy & Vision
Current Level: [1-5]
Evidence: [List evidence]
Gaps: [List gaps]
Next Steps: [List actions]

## Governance & Responsible AI
Current Level: [1-5]
Evidence: [List evidence]
Gaps: [List gaps]
Next Steps: [List actions]

[... repeat for all 6 dimensions]
```

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Technology Ahead of People
**Symptom**: Strong technology capabilities but low adoption
**Solution**: Focus on change management and upskilling

### Pattern 2: Strategy Without Execution
**Symptom**: Good strategy but no systematic implementation
**Solution**: Build execution capabilities and governance

### Pattern 3: Pilots Without Scale
**Symptom**: Many successful pilots but no production systems
**Solution**: Invest in ModelOps and scaling infrastructure

### Pattern 4: Data Not Ready
**Symptom**: AI projects stalled by data quality issues
**Solution**: Prioritize data governance and quality

## Using Assessment Results

### For Prioritization
Use maturity levels to select appropriate prioritization frameworks:
- **Level 1-2**: Use simple Impact/Effort matrix
- **Level 3**: Use Value/Actionability/Feasibility matrix
- **Level 4-5**: Use strategic frameworks (Differentiability Index)

### For Roadmap Planning
Lower maturity dimensions need more foundational work before advanced capabilities.

### For Resource Allocation
Invest more in dimensions that are blocking other progress.

## Next Steps

1. **Conduct Assessment**: Use the [Interactive Maturity Assessment Tool](/tools/assessments/maturity-assessment)
2. **Document Findings**: Create maturity profile
3. **Prioritize**: Identify critical gaps and quick wins
4. **Plan**: Use results to inform [Strategic Prioritization](/docs/adoption-engine/prioritization)
5. **Track Progress**: Re-assess quarterly to measure improvement
