# Part 4: The Adoption Engine: From Readiness to Scaled Industrialization

This section provides the 5-phase execution engine for moving from an ad-hoc, chaotic state to a mature, value-driven "AI factory."

## The 5-Phase Framework

### Phase 1: Readiness Assessment (Where Are We?)
Before building a roadmap, an organization must know its starting point. Use an AI Maturity Model to assess technology, data, processes, and people.

### Phase 2: Strategic Prioritization (What Do We Do First?)
Move "from chasing AI use cases to using AI to fulfill business strategy." Use prioritization frameworks based on your maturity level.

### Phase 3: Building the Roadmap (How Do We Get There?)
Gartner's 7-Workstream AI Roadmap provides the most comprehensive, human-centric model for planning your journey.

### Phase 4: Measuring True Value (Was It Worth It?)
Move beyond simple ROI to a multi-dimensional framework: ROI, ROE (Return on Employee), and ROF (Return on Future).

### Phase 5: Scaling from Pilot to Production (The "AI Factory")
The final step: transition successful pilots to production with proper ModelOps capabilities.

## The Challenge

- **95% of pilots fail to scale**
- **30% of GenAI projects** will be abandoned after PoC in 2025
- **Root cause**: Leaders use pilots as "technology experiments" instead of "implementation preparation"

## The Solution

These 5 phases must be executed systematically, with each phase building on the previous one. The primary reason pilots fail to scale is that organizations only focus on Engineering and Data during the pilot, and forget Strategy, People, and Governance until it is too late.

## Quick Start

1. **Assess**: Take the [AI Maturity Assessment](/tools/assessments/maturity-assessment)
2. **Prioritize**: Use the [Prioritization Calculator](/tools/calculators/prioritization)
3. **Plan**: Follow the [7-Workstream Roadmap](/docs/adoption-engine/roadmap)
4. **Measure**: Track ROI, ROE, and ROF
5. **Scale**: Build your "AI Factory" with ModelOps

## Key Principles

- **Start with business problems, not technology solutions**
- **Run all 7 workstreams in parallel** (don't focus only on Engineering and Data)
- **Measure value, not just usage**
- **Design for scale from the start** (pilots should be implementation preparation)

## Next Steps

- **New to AI adoption?** → Start with [Readiness Assessment](/docs/adoption-engine/readiness-assessment)
- **Ready to prioritize?** → Use [Strategic Prioritization](/docs/adoption-engine/prioritization)
- **Building roadmap?** → Follow [7-Workstream Framework](/docs/adoption-engine/roadmap)
- **Measuring success?** → Track [ROI, ROE, and ROF](/docs/adoption-engine/measuring-value)
- **Scaling up?** → Build your [AI Factory](/docs/adoption-engine/scaling-production)
