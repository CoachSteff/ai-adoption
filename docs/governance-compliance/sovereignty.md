# Digital Sovereignty: The European Cloud Strategy

## The Sovereignty Challenge

A growing C-suite-level concern is Europe's over-dependence on US hyperscalers. Amazon, Microsoft, and Google control over 80% of the EU's IaaS market.

This is not just about data location. As analysis from 2025 notes, "Even if data is physically located in Europe, a US court ruling can lead to closure."

## The Strategic Opportunity

### What is Sovereign Cloud?

Gartner defines Sovereign Cloud as cloud services ensuring "data, operational, and technological control."

### Market Growth

This market is projected to grow at an **86% CAGR**, from:
- 10% market share in 2024
- To 47% by 2028

### Competitive Advantage

While US hyperscalers are responding with products like the "Microsoft Sovereign Cloud," sovereignty is no longer just risk mitigation; it is a **competitive advantage**.

An EU enterprise that builds its AI services on a true sovereign cloud can use this "trust" as a key differentiator to win EU customers.

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Assessment Phase

**Current State Analysis:**
- Map all AI workloads and data flows
- Identify dependencies on non-EU providers
- Assess regulatory and strategic risks
- Calculate cost implications

### 2. Strategic Planning

**Sovereignty Framework:**
- Define sovereignty requirements (data, operational, technological)
- Prioritize workloads for migration
- Identify sovereign cloud providers
- Develop migration roadmap

### 3. Vendor Evaluation

**Key Criteria:**
- Data residency guarantees
- Operational independence from non-EU entities
- Technology stack sovereignty
- Compliance with EU regulations
- Financial stability and market position

### 4. Migration Approach

**Phased Implementation:**
- Start with high-risk/high-value workloads
- Pilot with non-critical applications
- Establish governance and monitoring
- Scale systematically

## Business Case

### Risk Mitigation

- **Legal Protection**: Immunity from foreign jurisdiction
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Easier GDPR and AI Act adherence
- **Strategic Independence**: Reduced geopolitical risk

### Competitive Differentiation

- **Customer Trust**: EU customers prefer EU-sovereign solutions
- **Market Positioning**: "Privacy by Design" as USP
- **Premium Pricing**: Justify higher prices with sovereignty guarantees

### Long-term Value

- **Future-Proofing**: Aligned with EU digital strategy
- **Innovation**: Access to EU-specific innovations
- **Ecosystem**: Participation in EU digital ecosystem

## Key Considerations

:::warning Balanced Approach
Sovereignty doesn't mean isolationism. Consider a **hybrid strategy**:
- Sovereign cloud for sensitive workloads
- Global hyperscalers for commodity services
- Clear governance for data classification
