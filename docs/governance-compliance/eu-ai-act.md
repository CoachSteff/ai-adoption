# Navigating the EU AI Act: A Practical Compliance Path

The EU AI Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689) is in force, establishing a risk-based pyramid for AI systems.

## Risk Categories

### Unacceptable Risk: Banned
Examples: Social scoring, real-time biometric identification in public spaces

### High-Risk: Strictly Regulated
Examples:
- CV-sorting software
- Credit scoring systems
- Biometric identification systems
- Medical devices with AI

**Requirements**: Conformity assessments, quality management systems, risk management systems, data governance, transparency, human oversight, accuracy, robustness, cybersecurity

### Limited Risk: Subject to Transparency
Examples: Chatbots, emotion recognition systems, deepfakes

**Requirements**: Users must be informed they are interacting with AI

### Minimal Risk: Largely Unregulated
Examples: AI-powered video games, spam filters

**Requirements**: No specific obligations (but must comply with other applicable laws like GDPR)

## Compliance Deadlines

- **February 2025**: Prohibitions on unacceptable AI took effect
- **August 2025**: Governance rules and obligations for General-Purpose AI (GPAI) models became applicable

## 6-Point Compliance Action Plan

### 1. Establish Complete AI Inventory
- Catalog all AI systems in use
- Classify each by risk level (High, Limited, Minimal)
- Document system purpose and scope

### 2. Clarify Your Role
Determine if your organization is:
- **Supplier**: Develops AI systems
- **Modifier**: Modifies existing AI systems
- **Deployer**: Uses AI systems developed by others

### 3. Prepare Technical Documentation
- Technical documentation for high-risk systems
- Transparency documentation for limited-risk systems
- User instructions and information

### 4. Implement Copyright and Data Protection
- Ensure compliance with copyright laws
- Implement GDPR requirements
- Conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA) where required

### 5. Train and Verify AI Competence
- Provide AI literacy training to all employees using AI systems
- Verify understanding of AI capabilities and limitations
- Document training completion

### 6. Adapt Internal Governance Structures
- Appoint responsible persons for AI governance
- Establish AI steering committee
- Create policies and procedures

## Practical Tools

### 1. NIST AI RMF for EU AI Act Compliance

The EU AI Act is the law (the "what"), but the US-based **NIST AI Risk Management Framework (RMF)** is the voluntary process (the "how"). It provides the clear roadmap to build the exact risk management systems the EU Act mandates.

**How to use**: Map NIST AI RMF functions to EU AI Act requirements:
- **Govern**: Establish policies and procedures
- **Map**: Identify and document AI systems
- **Measure**: Assess and manage risks
- **Manage**: Implement controls and monitoring

### 2. GPAI Code of Practice

This voluntary tool demonstrates compliance for:
- Transparency requirements
- Copyright obligations
- Safety and security standards

**Benefit**: Reduces administrative burden while demonstrating compliance

### 3. AI Act Compliance Checker

The [official EU AI Act Compliance Checker](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/assessment/eu-ai-act-compliance-checker/) is designed specifically for SMEs to understand their legal obligations.

**Use it to**:
- Understand which requirements apply to your organization
- Get guidance on compliance steps
- Identify gaps in current practices

## Common Challenges

### Challenge: Shadow AI Makes Inventory Impossible

**Problem**: Employees using unsanctioned AI tools makes a "complete AI inventory" nearly impossible.

**Solution**: 
- Implement the [4-Step Shadow AI Management Plan](/docs/human-centric-adoption/shadow-ai)
- Use AI TRiSM Layer 2 (Runtime Inspection) to detect unauthorized usage
- Create acceptable use policies

### Challenge: Implementation Gap

**Problem**: 46 European companies have pleaded with the Commission for a two-year pause, citing "reasonable implementation" challenges.

**Solution**: Start with available tools (NIST AI RMF, Compliance Checker) rather than waiting for perfect clarity.

## Compliance Matrix

| Regulatory Domain | Primary Mandate | Actionable Framework | Key Stakeholder |
|------------------|----------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| EU AI Act | Risk-based classification & documentation | 1. Use NIST AI RMF<br/>2. Use AI Act Compliance Checker | CAIO, Legal |
| GPAI Models | Transparency, Copyright, Safety | Adopt GPAI Code of Practice | CAIO, CTO |
| Internal Misuse | Preventing policy violations | Implement AI TRiSM Layer 2 | CISO, CTO |
| Cybersecurity | Securing AI supply chain | Integrate into NIS2 policies | CISO, CTO |
| Data Sovereignty | Reducing big tech dependence | Develop Sovereign Cloud strategy | CTO, CEO |
| Agentic AI | Managing autonomous systems | Mandate 6-Point Agentic Framework | CAIO, Business Owner |

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Use the [AI Act Compliance Checker](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/assessment/eu-ai-act-compliance-checker/)
2. **This Week**: Establish AI inventory and risk classification
3. **This Month**: Adopt NIST AI RMF as your compliance process
4. **Ongoing**: Monitor for updates and new guidance
