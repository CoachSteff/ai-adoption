# Governing Agentic AI: The New Frontier

## What is Agentic AI?

**Agentic AI** refers to autonomous systems that can make decisions and take actions independently. Unlike traditional AI that responds to prompts, agentic AI can:

- Set and pursue goals autonomously
- Make decisions without human intervention
- Take actions across multiple systems
- Learn and adapt from outcomes

## The Adoption Reality

- **62% of organizations** are already experimenting with agentic AI
- This is happening **without regulatory frameworks**
- Reports note that "gaps remain for autonomous systems"

## The Governance Gap

:::danger Critical Risk
Agentic AI is being rapidly adopted in a **governance vacuum**. Without proper controls, autonomous agents can:
- Make unauthorized business decisions
- Access sensitive data without proper controls
- Create compliance violations automatically
- Amplify errors at scale
:::

## Deloitte's 6-Point Governance Framework

To prevent catastrophic risk, all agentic AI pilots must be governed by a structured framework:

### 1. Role-Based Design
**Objective:** Reduce complexity through clear role definition

- Assign agents to specific, well-defined roles
- Avoid "general purpose" autonomous agents
- Define clear boundaries for each agent's authority
- Document role responsibilities and limitations

### 2. Domain Tailoring
**Objective:** Specialize agents for specific business areas

- Restrict agents to specific business domains
- Align agent capabilities with domain requirements
- Prevent cross-domain access without approval
- Build domain-specific expertise into agents

### 3. Balance Responsibilities
**Objective:** Avoid bottlenecks or governance chaos

- Distribute decision-making authority appropriately
- Prevent single points of failure
- Avoid creating ungoverned "super-agents"
- Maintain clear accountability chains

### 4. Controlled Access ⚠️
**MOST CRITICAL:** Limit agents to essential resources only

**Data Access:**
- Grant minimum necessary data access
- Implement dynamic access controls
- Log all data access by agents
- Regular access reviews and audits

**Tool Access:**
- Whitelist approved tools and APIs
- Restrict high-risk capabilities (e.g., financial transactions)
- Implement approval workflows for sensitive actions
- Monitor tool usage patterns

**Skills & Capabilities:**
- Define explicit capability boundaries
- Prevent capability escalation
- Regular capability assessments
- Emergency override mechanisms

### 5. Prioritize Feedback
**Objective:** Design for human-in-the-loop oversight

**Feedback Mechanisms:**
- Real-time monitoring dashboards
- Decision audit trails
- Alert systems for high-risk actions
- Human approval gates for critical decisions

**Human Oversight:**
- Define scenarios requiring human approval
- Establish escalation procedures
- Create feedback loops for agent improvement
- Regular human review of agent behavior

### 6. Embrace Reinvention
**Objective:** Allow transformative process change

- Design agents to reimagine processes, not just automate
- Encourage innovative approaches
- Measure transformation impact
- Balance innovation with control

## Implementation Checklist

### Before Deploying Agentic AI

- [ ] **Risk Assessment**: Comprehensive risk analysis completed
- [ ] **Governance Framework**: 6-point framework implemented
- [ ] **Access Controls**: Minimum necessary access defined
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring in place
- [ ] **Escalation**: Clear escalation procedures established
- [ ] **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging enabled
- [ ] **Kill Switch**: Emergency shutdown mechanism tested
- [ ] **Human Oversight**: Approval workflows configured
- [ ] **Compliance Check**: Legal and regulatory review completed
- [ ] **Training**: Team trained on governance procedures

### During Operation

- [ ] Daily monitoring of agent activities
- [ ] Weekly review of decision quality
- [ ] Monthly access rights audit
- [ ] Quarterly governance framework review
- [ ] Continuous feedback collection
- [ ] Regular capability boundary assessment

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Scenarios Requiring Approval

1. **Financial Transactions** above defined thresholds
2. **Data Access** to sensitive/regulated information
3. **External Communications** with customers or partners
4. **System Modifications** to production environments
5. **Policy Changes** affecting other systems or users

### Monitoring & Alerts

**Critical Alerts:**
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Out-of-bounds decision-making
- Unusual behavioral patterns
- Policy violations
- System errors or failures

**Performance Metrics:**
- Decision accuracy
- Goal achievement rate
- Resource efficiency
- Compliance rate
- Human intervention frequency

## Future Considerations
