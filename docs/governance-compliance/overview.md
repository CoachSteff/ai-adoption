# Part 2: The EU-Centric Foundation: Governance, Trust, and Sovereignty

This section provides the non-negotiable governance scaffolding for any EU enterprise. This is not "red tape"; it is the enabling framework that builds trust, manages risk, and unlocks sustainable adoption.

## Why Governance Matters

Governance is not a barrier—it's an **enabler**. Proper governance:
- Builds trust with stakeholders
- Manages risk effectively
- Unlocks sustainable adoption
- Ensures compliance with EU regulations

## Key Regulatory Frameworks

### EU AI Act
Risk-based regulation establishing four risk categories:
- **Unacceptable Risk**: Banned (e.g., social scoring)
- **High-Risk**: Strictly regulated (e.g., CV-sorting, credit scoring, biometric ID)
- **Limited Risk**: Subject to transparency (e.g., chatbots)
- **Minimal Risk**: Largely unregulated

**Deadlines**: Prohibitions took effect February 2025. Governance rules for GPAI models became applicable August 2025.

### NIS2 Directive
Cybersecurity risk management rules covering:
- Supply chain security
- Security in acquisitions
- Incident reporting

### GDPR
Data protection requirements that apply to all AI systems processing personal data.
