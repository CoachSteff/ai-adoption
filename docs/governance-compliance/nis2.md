# NIS2 Directive: AI as Cybersecurity Risk

## Overview

AI systems are software. This means in addition to the EU AI Act, they fall under the EU's [NIS2 Directive](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis2-directive) cybersecurity risk management rules.

## Key Requirements

### Supply Chain Security

When an enterprise buys an AI service (e.g., from OpenAI, Microsoft), that vendor is part of the supply chain. NIS2 requires the enterprise to vet the vendor's "cybersecurity practices," including their secure development procedures.

### Security in Acquisitions

When an enterprise acquires a new AI platform, it must define security requirements in the technical specifications.

## Integration Strategy

The CAIO and CTO must create a unified procurement policy. They cannot assess a new AI tool only for EU AI Act risk; they must simultaneously assess it for NIS2 supply chain risk.

### Action Steps

1. **Vendor Assessment Framework**
   - Develop cybersecurity vetting checklist for AI vendors
   - Review vendor's secure development lifecycle
   - Assess vendor's incident response capabilities
   - Verify compliance certifications

2. **Procurement Process Integration**
   - Update technical specifications to include security requirements
   - Create unified assessment combining EU AI Act and NIS2
   - Establish approval workflow involving both CAIO and CISO

3. **Ongoing Monitoring**
   - Regular vendor security audits
   - Continuous monitoring of supply chain risks
   - Incident reporting procedures
