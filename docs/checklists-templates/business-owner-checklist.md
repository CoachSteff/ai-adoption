- [ ] Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) tracked (including hidden costs)
- [ ] Value measurement goes beyond simple cost savings

### Baseline & Measurement
- [ ] Baselines established before AI rollout (2-4 week time-and-quality studies)
- [ ] A/B testing or staggered rollout used to prove causality
- [ ] Measurement methodology documented
- [ ] Regular measurement reviews scheduled

## Adoption & Governance (Part 3.4)

### Shadow AI Awareness
