# AI Change Management Playbook

## Reframing the Challenge

AI adoption is an **emotional transition**, not a software update.

Leaders must "acknowledge those emotional bonds" a 20-year veteran has to their old processes. This is about **behavior change**, not technology deployment.

## McKinsey's "Rewired" Framework

The "Rewired" playbook provides the execution model for AI transformation. AI change management is not a step in the project; **it is the project**.

### The Five Pillars

#### 1. Vision and Roadmap
**Objective:** Create a compelling narrative for change

**Elements:**
- **Compelling Change Story**: Why we must change, why now
- **Shared Vision**: Where we're going together
- **Strategic Alignment**: How AI serves business goals
- **Clear Benefits**: What's in it for everyone

**Deliverables:**
- Written change narrative
- Visual roadmap
- Communication plan
- Stakeholder engagement strategy

#### 2. Talent
**Objective:** Build capability to execute transformation

See [The HRBP's 6-Step Upskilling Framework](./upskilling.md) for detailed guidance.

**Key Components:**
- Skills gap assessment
- Role redesign
- Training programs
- Career pathways
- Retention strategy

#### 3. Operating Model
**Objective:** Redesign workflows and business processes

**Transformation Areas:**
- Process redesign for AI augmentation
- Decision rights and governance
- Team structures and collaboration
- Performance management
- Innovation processes

**Approach:**
- Map current state processes
- Envision future state with AI
- Design transition plan
- Pilot and iterate
- Scale systematically

#### 4. Data and AI
**Objective:** Build governance and platform foundation

See [Governance & Compliance](../governance-compliance/overview.md) for detailed frameworks.

**Key Elements:**
- AI governance structure
- Risk management (AI TRiSM)
- Regulatory compliance
- Data governance
- Ethical AI principles

#### 5. Technology
**Objective:** Create scalable infrastructure

See [Scaling to Production](../adoption-engine/scaling-production.md) for technical playbook.

**Infrastructure Needs:**
- Cloud and compute platforms
- ModelOps capabilities
- Integration architecture
- Security and monitoring
- Development environments

## The Emotional Journey

### Understanding Resistance

**Common Fears:**
- Job security concerns

**Resistance Manifestations:**

### Managing the Transition Curve

**1. Denial/Shock**
- **Emotion**: "This isn't really happening"
- **Leadership Response**: Clear, consistent communication
- **Actions**: Share reality, timeline, and plan

**2. Resistance**
- **Emotion**: "I don't want this"
- **Leadership Response**: Listen, acknowledge, engage
- **Actions**: Address concerns, involve in solutions

**3. Exploration**
- **Emotion**: "Maybe this could work"
- **Leadership Response**: Support, coach, encourage
- **Actions**: Provide resources, celebrate experiments

**4. Commitment**
