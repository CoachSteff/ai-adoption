# Part 3: The Human-Centric Operating Model: Change, Talent, and the New EVP

AI doesn't fail because the model is wrong; it fails because the new workflow is wrong, the training is missing, and the human is an afterthought. This section details the core "human behavior" elements of adoption.

## The Human Element

**81% of AI adoption failures are human-centric:**
- **43%** from leadership alignment and organizational resistance
- **38%** from insufficient training

This section provides frameworks to address these challenges.

4. [Shadow AI Management](/docs/human-centric-adoption/shadow-ai) - 4-step playbook to turn risk into opportunity

## The Silent Impacts

Deloitte's 2025 Global Human Capital Trends warn of "silent, unintended impacts":

- **Burnout & Difficulty**: AI handles easy tasks, leaving humans with only the hardest tasks
- **Loneliness & Isolation**: AI reduces person-to-person interaction
- **Loss of Agency**: AI reduces human decision-making
- **Loss of Learning**: AI automates entry-level tasks, removing training grounds

## The Solution: Proactive Human-Centric Design

1. **Study the Impacts**: Use anthropological research, surveys, and focus groups
2. **Share the AI Plan**: Be transparent about how AI will augment, not replace
3. **Forge HR-Tech Partnership**: CHRO and CTO must co-own this transformation
4. **Share the Rewards**: Answer "How will workers share in the value AI creates?"
5. **Enable Reciprocal Learning**: Guarantee new learning opportunities
6. **Empower Experimentation**: Provide tools and psychological safety
