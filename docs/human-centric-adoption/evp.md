# Employee Value Proposition for the AI Era

## The New Employment Contract

The worker-employer relationship is being rewritten by AI. The stakes are high:

:::tip Key Statistic
Over **70% of managers and workers** are "more likely to join and stay with" a company if its EVP helps them thrive in an AI-driven world.
:::

## The Leadership Challenge

Leaders must navigate critical tensions:
- **Automation vs. Augmentation**: Will AI replace or enhance human work?
- **Control vs. Empowerment**: Will AI constrain or liberate employees?

## Silent, Unintended Impacts of AI

Deloitte's 2025 Global Human Capital Trends warn that AI, while automating rote work, is having "silent, unintended impacts":

### 1. Burnout & Difficulty
- AI handles easy tasks, leaving humans with only the most complex work
- Concentration of "hardest tasks" increases cognitive load
- Reduced variety in work increases fatigue

### 2. Loneliness & Isolation
- AI reduces person-to-person interaction
- Loss of collaborative moments
- Decreased social connection at work

### 3. Loss of Agency
- AI reduces human decision-making opportunities
- Diminished sense of control
- Reduced job satisfaction

### 4. Loss of Learning
- AI automates "entry-level" tasks
- Removes traditional "training ground" for new employees
- Skills development pathways disrupted
