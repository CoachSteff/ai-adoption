# Welcome to the Open-Source AI Adoption Playbook

## What Is This Playbook?

This is a comprehensive, human-centric framework for AI adoption in EU enterprises. Unlike vendor playbooks that focus on technology, this guide addresses the **real barrier to AI success**: the human element.

## The Problem We're Solving

Enterprise AI adoption in 2025 faces a critical paradox:

- **95%** of organizations report zero measurable ROI from AI investments
- **42%** abandon AI projects before production (up from 17% the previous year)
- **81%** of adoption failures are human-centric (leadership + training issues)

This is not a technology failure—it's a **human adoption failure**.

## Our Approach

This playbook re-frames AI adoption as a **change management and organizational design challenge**. It provides:

1. **Actionable governance models** for EU compliance
2. **Human capital frameworks** for change and talent development
3. **Scalable execution engine** from pilot to production
4. **Role-specific checklists** for immediate action

## Key Principles

### 1. Human-First, Not AI-First

Design systems that adapt to people rather than forcing people to adapt to technology.

### 2. Evidence-Based

All frameworks are grounded in 2024-2025 research from McKinsey, Gartner, Deloitte, and real-world implementations.

### 3. EU-Centric

Comprehensive coverage of EU AI Act, NIS2, GDPR, and digital sovereignty requirements.

### 4. Actionable

Every section includes practical tools, checklists, and next steps—not just theory.

### 5. Evolving

This playbook is continuously updated as AI adoption practices mature.
