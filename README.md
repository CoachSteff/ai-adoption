## 🎯 Mission

This open-source playbook provides actionable frameworks, checklists, and guidance for business owners, HR Business Partners, CTOs, CAIOs, and executive stakeholders seeking to deploy and scale AI effectively in EU enterprises.

**Key Focus**: AI Adoption is a **human behavior change challenge**, not just a technical integration problem.

## ✨ What Makes This Different

- **Human-Centric Approach**: Addresses the "human element" that causes 81% of AI adoption failures
- **EU-Focused**: Comprehensive coverage of EU AI Act, NIS2, GDPR compliance
- **Evidence-Based**: Grounded in 2024-2025 research from McKinsey, Gartner, Deloitte, and real-world implementations
- **Actionable**: Practical frameworks, checklists, and tools—not just theory
- **Open-Source**: Freely available, community-driven, continuously updated
- **Immediately Usable**: Start applying frameworks Monday morning
